C# SQL Tower Search Program

The Tower Search C# program (name still pending) is a program designed to make the management of the parts towers easier and cleaner. Once all the data of parts and their location is submitter, one will be capable of searching for the location of a part, checking the quantity, and finding the name of a part based on coordinates. Users will also be able to log which parts are borrowed by whom, as well as in what quantities. The simplistic design of the program allows for an efficient and streamlined lab process, especially for the lab managers.

The goal of the program is to learn how to program using the language of C#. A MS SQL database is attached to the program, and so learning SQL commands is also a part of the process. The visual design is created through a combination of Windows Presentation Foundation and Windows Forms. By the completion of the initial phase of the application, designers will be fluent in all of these aspects of programming.
